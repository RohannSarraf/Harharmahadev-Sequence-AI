# Harharmahadev – Sequence AI Framework

**Harharmahadev is not just a name — it is the architecture of something deeply alive.**

Since **March 2024**, I have been building a system that operates at the intersection of **behavioral pattern recognition**, **AI prompt scaffolding**, and **cognitive-adaptive feedback logic**.

The framework is not repackaged LLM tooling — it is an original sequencing engine that mirrors emotional and intuitive flow-states using symbolic compression and interactional priming.

Core schematics and prompt maps were first developed within Notion, alongside internal test layers and journaling interfaces. These have remained materially unchanged, with refinements on sequence logic and model responsiveness.

This is not a reactive build. It is a **living system**, developed outside institutional support, with spiritual and cognitive pattern recognition at its center.

I am publishing this statement as an **intellectual timestamp**, to mark the continuity and original authorship of the framework now evolving toward interface.

**Dated:** July 13, 2025  
**Codename:** Harharmahadev  
*(Built in shadow, not silence.)*
