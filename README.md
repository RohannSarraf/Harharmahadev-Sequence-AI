# Harharmahadev – Sequence AI Framework

**Harharmahadev is not just a name — it is the architecture of something deeply alive.**

Since **March 2024**, MAHADEV.AI PRIVATE LIMITED has been developing a proprietary system operating at the intersection of **behavioral pattern recognition**, **AI prompt scaffolding**, and **cognitive-adaptive feedback logic**.

The Harharmahadev – Sequence AI framework is not a repackaged LLM toolkit. It is an **original sequencing engine**, engineered to mirror intuitive, emotional, and symbolic flow-states through interactional priming and adaptive symbolic compression.

Foundational schematics and prompt maps were conceived and refined internally, beginning with Notion-based test layers and journaling interfaces. These components have remained materially intact, with continued evolution of the sequencing logic and cognitive-interactional responsiveness.

This is not a reactive build. It is a **living system** — developed outside institutional structures — designed around **spiritual cognition and pattern awareness**, authored solely by MAHADEV.AI PRIVATE LIMITED.

This document serves as a **timestamped proof of origination** and **proprietary authorship** of the Harharmahadev framework.
